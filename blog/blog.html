                    My name’s Isabel, and my creative journey began with photography and film in middle school and high school, where I developed a love for visual storytelling. As I grew, I shifted toward graphic design, drawn to the challenge of balancing aesthetics with functionality. I spent time learning design principles and digital tools, which deepened my passion for visual communication.

                    Then, I took a big leap into coding. Initially daunting, coding quickly became another powerful tool for creating art. I realized it allowed me to explore interactive and dynamic designs in ways I hadn't imagined before. Now, as a Design and Technology major at Parsons, I’m excited to merge my roots in traditional arts with the creative potential of computational design. Below, you’ll find some of my projects from my critical computation course.

                <!-- Project #1 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#1 Lost and Found</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/C6c729Wmj"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        This was my first time working in p5.js, and it definitely showed. I partnered with Pam, who described an item they lost as a child. I ended up piecing together a big clue about what it was—a Blue's Clues plushie. I remember spending so much time trying to get everything in the right position, constantly tweaking and adjusting. It was a slow process, but looking back, it taught me a lot about patience and figuring things out step by step.

                <!-- Project #2 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#2 Face Generator</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/0k2oU2TDv"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        I was exploring how easily I get distracted while doing simple tasks and how even the smallest thought can derail me. In my data portrait, clicking the screen creates small “fishes” that represent my thoughts swimming in the background. Clicking and dragging the mouse increases the chaos, symbolizing how I lose track and start juggling multiple tasks at once. To create this, I tracked how often I got distracted in a week and turned that data into an array in p5.js. Designing the natural yet chaotic movement of the fishes took a lot of tweaking, as I worked to balance attraction and distraction behaviors to reflect my struggles with focus.

                <!-- Project #3 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#3 Experimental Clock</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/O4OtO4csQ"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        The experimental clock I designed uses abstract shapes—circles, squares, and triangles—to represent hours, minutes, and seconds. Instead of traditional clock hands, these shapes orbit and rotate in response to mouse movement, creating a dynamic, interactive experience. The fluid transitions and pulsating shapes give the clock a "trippy" feel, making time appear kinetic and ever-changing.

                <!-- Project #4 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#4 Exquisite Corpse</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/IZ4F-zVbX"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Pam and I began by exchanging ideas and sketches, with Pam designing a quirky squid character whose expressions shift through shapes and colors, while I created a troll-faced alien to add a mischievous touch. We reached out to our partners, and Chen Yun Ma joined us to help troubleshoot our code, which was more challenging than expected. Together, we brought the project to life, and we’re now waiting for Chen’s character to be added. Our underwater sci-fi story follows Squiddy, the Troll Alien, and a yet-to-be-revealed character as they explore a glowing cavern, using their unique skills to solve puzzles and collaborate creatively. Despite setbacks, working with Pam and Chen was rewarding, and I’m proud of the progress we’ve made so far.

                <!-- Project #5 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#5 Optical Illusions</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/gFsr_hD3b"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        In my design, I explored the waterfall illusion using syncopated dots to create a dynamic interplay of negative and positive space, enhancing the sense of motion. I love how illusions invite curiosity and challenge perception. For deployment, the design could become a browser extension, offering a captivating visual break, or wearable art like clothing and accessories that appear to move with the wearer, blending art and fashion into everyday life.

                <!-- Project #6 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#6 Data Portrait</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/VsXkWLNc9"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to track how easily I get distracted by everyday tasks. It’s surprising how even a small thought can pull me off track, and staying focused is something I’ve struggled with for years.Once I had the data, I translated it into an array in p5.js, allowing me to visualize the chaotic nature of my scattered thoughts. The "fishes" in the design represent these thoughts, slowly moving and interacting with the environment. The more I clicked and dragged, the more chaotic the scene became, reflecting how I juggle multiple tasks when my focus slips. The process involved a lot of trial and error, tweaking the behavior of the elements to feel more natural and true to how distractions actually unfold in my day-to-day life.

                <!-- Project #7 -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h1>#7 Autobiographical Game</h1>
                    <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/zlati011/full/r1qhWxErg"></iframe>
                    <P>
                        I created this autobiographical game as a way to document my journey of self-discovery through music. Over the years, music has been a constant source of expression and connection for me, helping me navigate my emotions and experiences. I wanted the game to reflect how music has shaped my identity, from overcoming insecurities to finding a sense of community and confidence. By using the game as a medium, I could share this personal journey in a more interactive and immersive way. Through the main character's exploration and growth, I hope to capture the transformative power of music and how it can help people find themselves and their place in the world.
