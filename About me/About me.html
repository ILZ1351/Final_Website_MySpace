                    Hi! My name’s Isabel, and I’ve been immersed in the arts since I was in the 6th grade. Growing up in an art-focused environment shaped me into someone with a deep appreciation for exploring different forms of media. My creative journey started with photography—I spent a few years honing my eye for capturing moments. Then, I shifted my focus to graphic design, where I found joy in creating visually compelling works.

                    Eventually, my passion for storytelling and interactive experiences led me to video games. I was captivated by the idea of creating my own game, but for a long time, I felt intimidated by coding. It seemed like this massive, complex world I wasn’t sure I could navigate. Over time, though, I started to pick up the basics, and now I love using coding to bring my creative ideas to life.

                    When I’m not working on school projects, I spend my time creating music with my friends and just hanging out. Music has always been a huge part of my life—it’s a creative outlet that feels freeing and collaborative. Here is a link to my band: <iframe

                <p>
                    As for my future, I’m really excited about the possibilities coding opens up. My ultimate goal is to work with a game company or dive into virtual reality development. I love the idea of crafting immersive experiences that let people escape, connect, or even see the world in new ways.

Technology and coding have definitely become tools I see as creative partners. They were once intimidating, but now they feel like keys to unlock entirely new worlds of possibilities. I’m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and seeing where this journey takes me!
