                <h2>How Music Has Impacted Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Music has always been more than just sound to me—it’s a force that has shaped my life in ways I couldn’t have imagined. It’s therapeutic, a way for me to work through emotions and find clarity when I feel overwhelmed. Picking up a guitar or diving into a playlist isn’t just a pastime; it’s a lifeline. There’s something about the rhythm and melody that quiets the noise in my mind, helping me reset and feel like myself again.

                    Beyond its personal impact, music has given me a social life that I’m incredibly grateful for. It’s connected me with a community of like-minded people who share the same passion for creativity, self-expression, and the energy that music brings to a room. The local NYC scene has been especially transformative for me. There’s an unmatched vibe in the city’s DIY spaces, where people gather in basements, under bridges, or in tiny venues to celebrate music in its rawest form.

                    I picked up guitar in 2020 as a past time quarantine hobby, i really though id just pick it up for a few monthd and forget about it. But as my music taste expanded i really strived to play more. id say about 6 months in i started to see a lot of improvements. As i carried one and covid restraints setled i started to go out more and went to a few local shows. i would say that it chanegd my life for the better. I'm orignally from South Florida and the local scene there was peak when i joined. It was nothing but fun.

                        I've been in and out of bands for 2 years now my first band was called Bloodtied and we were a brutal death metal band. I sadly had to quit due to me moving away for college and theyre still at it! But here is a clip of one of our live shows:<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeV6-P8mvDE?si=EOX_Ws8dub-p0hYt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
